# My first 'git sourced' blog

Today I wanted to apply 'GitOps' to my blogs.
Would it be possible, easy and benificial to develop blogs and content with
Markdown in a git repository while still using Wordpress for publishing the content?
That was the quest of the day :smile:

So here's my first 'git sourced' blog!

Source file in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/marcvanandel/marcvanandel.nl-bliki/blob/main/my-first-git-sourced-blog.md)
and published static page in Wordpress on [marcvanandel.nl](https://marcvanandel.nl/).
And? Does that work?
